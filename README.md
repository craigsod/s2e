Simple2Edit CMS

This is a simple CMS using PHP, MySQL, CKEditor and CKFinder. There is very little JavaScript.

The repository is set up to help with the refactoring of the CMS
Upgrades needed
- To be compatible with PHP 7.4+
- Compatible with all server environments we use (or will use)
- Clean up Placecode process and make it easier to use
- Look into have some parts of the system be centralized to make updates easier
- Use single header and footer system.
- Create system for automating the initial setup - for new as well as existing account
- Add admin notes section
- Create simple photo gallery process
- Allow for per site customization - differences in how the site header/footer/content areas are defined
- Allow for custom styles

The main goal of the upgrade is to make the CMS more robust for the user and more stable. To give the users as much control over their websites as possible while also limiting the damage they can make. To also make it easier for the admin to install.
